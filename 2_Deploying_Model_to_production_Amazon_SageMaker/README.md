# Deploying Sentiment Analysis Web App

in this project we develop a machine learning model to predict the sentiment of a movie review. 
For this project, IMDB dataset is used to train XGBoost model. The model is then deployed to an endpoint. 
A very simple web app is constructed to interact with deployed endpoint. 


It also contains tutorials explaining how to build and deploy an xgboost model to predict the median value of a home in the area of Boston Mass.
