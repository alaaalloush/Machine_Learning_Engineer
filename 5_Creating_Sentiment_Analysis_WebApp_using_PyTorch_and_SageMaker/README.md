# Creating a Sentiment Analysis Web App using PyTorch and SageMaker


In this project we create a web app performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. It contains preparing and transforming Data using NLP concepts, training a LSTM neural network using PyTorch in SageMaker and deploying the model for the web app. The project also uses AWS services such as Lambda, IAM roles and API Gateway to access SageMaker endpoint.
