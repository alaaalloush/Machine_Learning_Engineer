# Building Sentiment Analysis Model Using XGBoost in SageMaker

In this project I build a model to predict the sentiment of a movie review. In this project I use XGBoost and SageMaker notebook instance to train the model. The project has the following steps:


   1- Download the data.
   2- Process / Prepare the data.
   3- Upload the processed data to S3.
   4- Train a chosen model.
   5- Test the trained model.


It also contains tutorials explaining how to build xgboost models to predict Boston housing prices using Amazon's SageMaker service and SageMaker's built-in XGBoost algorithm.
